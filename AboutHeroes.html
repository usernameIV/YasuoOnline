    <p id="p5">Vigilantes</p>

    <p>Samurai were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s during the Meiji era. They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo, the great feudal landholders. </p> 
    <p id="p2">Anti-hero is the term that designates the protagonist who does not possess the virtues traditionally attributed to heroes. Antiheroes are non-inherently evil characters who sometimes perform morally questionable acts. However, sometimes it is difficult to draw the line between antihero and villain.</p>
    <p id="p6">A vigilante is someone who, when a crime occurs, and is overcome by feelings of injustice in relation to the events, decides to act outside the law</p>
