    <p>A hero is a real person or fictional main character who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, courage, or strength. 
        Hero is the term attributed to a human being who performs exceptional actions, with courage and bravery, with the aim of resolving critical situations, based on moral and ethical principles. 
        Some describe a hero as someone with super powers, enemies to face, a great impossible love, while other people think that first and foremost, the hero must be someone good, who wants to help others and use their powers for good.
